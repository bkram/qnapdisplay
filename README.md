# Qnapdisplay

Qnap lcd display python module, features both writing to the display as wel as reading keypresses from the panel keys.
It was developed on a Qnap TS-459, but it will most likely also work on some other models as well.

## Supported Systems

Qnap systems that are known to work:

- TS-453A
- TS-459
- TVS-872X

## Module install

```bash
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/bkram/qnapdisplay.git
```

## Future

As my own lcd display has died, I can no longer maintain it myself, contributions are of course welcomed.
